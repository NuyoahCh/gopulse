# Einoflow Web Frontend

This folder contains the React 18 + TypeScript frontend built with Vite and TailwindCSS.

## Getting started

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app uses TailwindCSS, shadcn-inspired components, Lucide icons and Axios for API calls. Workflow data is fetched from `/api/workflows` and automatically falls back to mock data when the backend is unavailable.
